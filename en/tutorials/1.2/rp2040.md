# Raspberry Pi Pico boards and Mu

The Raspberry Pi Foundation makes amazing low cost microcontroller boards using the rp2040 
chipset.  These boards are capable of running 
[MicroPython](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html).

The extra functionality provided by rp2040 mode is contained in the following
buttons:

  <br/>
</div>

The "Run" button runs your Python code and opens the REPL pane to display any output.

The "REPL" button opens a serial data connection to the Raspberry Pi Pico board you
may have connected to your computer. This will result in a new pane between the
text editor and Mu's footer. Any serial data emitted from the device will
appear here. You can interact with the MicroPython REPL by clicking in the REPL pane 
to have focus.

The "Plotter" button opens Mu's plotter. If your device is outputting tuples
of numbers via the serial connection, the plotter will display them as a
graph. This is incredibly useful for visualising any data you might be
measuring via the device. For more information read the
[tutorial about Mu's plotter](plotter).
