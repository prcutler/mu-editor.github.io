# How to install Mu on Windows with the Official Installer 

Installing Mu in Windows is super easy.

Mu works on 64 bit versions of Windows. It's a good idea to make sure your system to up-to-date with all Windows updates.

If you are in an educational setting you may need to get your system administrator to run the installer for you.

**If you have a version of Mu older than version 1.1 already installed, we recommend that you
uninstall it first.  If you do not uninstall first, you will have two installations of Mu due to 
packaging changes with Mu versions 1.1 and newer.**

## Step 1 - Download Mu Installer

[Download](/en/download) the Windows installer.

## Step 2 - Run the installer

Find the installer you just downloaded (it's probably in your Downloads
folder). Double-click the installer to run it.
